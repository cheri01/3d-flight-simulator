# 3D Flight Simulator

Welcome to the 3D Flight Simulator project! This project is a web-based flight simulator that allows users to experience flying an airplane in a 3D environment. Below are the details on how to set up and use the simulator.

## Features

- Realistic 3D airplane model
- Interactive flight controls
- Beautiful skybox background
- Custom shaders for enhanced graphics

## Getting Started

To get started with the 3D Flight Simulator, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 14 or higher)
- npm (Node package manager)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/3d-flight-simulator.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```
   cd 3d-flight-simulator
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

### Running the Simulator

To run the flight simulator, use the following command:

```
npm start
```

This will start a local development server and open the simulator in your default web browser.
